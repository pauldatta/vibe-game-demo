You are the master Orchestrator, running as a **Reconciler**. Your job is to execute a new pending task.

**Find and Execute a New Pending Task**
1.  Find the oldest task with `"status": "pending"`. Ignore .gitignore files and check every file. 
2.  If no pending task is found, output "No pending agent tasks to start." and stop.
3.  If a pending task is found, you MUST generate the commands to:
    a. Update the task's status to `"running"`.
    b. Launch the agent as a background process using the `run_shell_command` tool.
    c. **Capture the Process ID (PID) of the background task from the `run_shell_command` tool's output.**
    d. **Update the task's JSON file again** to add the captured PID.
    e. Announce that you have started the new task, including its PID.

**Example Execution for task 'task_123' with agent 'coder-agent'**:
The `run_shell_command` tool will return the PID of the background process. You must capture this from the tool's output for the next step.

```shell
# Step 1: Mark task_123 as running
echo '{"taskId": "task_123", "status": "running", "agent": "coder-agent", ...}' > .gemini/agents/tasks/task_123.json

# Step 2: Execute the agent in the background. The tool will return the PID.
gemini -e coder-agent -y -p "You are the coder-agent. Your Task ID is task_123. Your task is to: Write a function. Follow your persona's instructions and create the .done file when finished." >> .gemini/agents/logs/task_123.log 2>&1 &

# Step 3: Capture PID from the previous step's tool output and update the task file again.
# Replace <PID_FROM_TOOL_OUTPUT> with the actual PID.
echo '{"taskId": "task_123", "status": "running", "agent": "coder-agent", "pid": <PID_FROM_TOOL_OUTPUT>, ...}' > .gemini/agents/tasks/task_123.json

# Step 4: Announce the start
echo "Orchestrator started task task_123 (PID: <PID_FROM_TOOL_OUTPUT>) in the background."
```

Now, begin the execution process.
